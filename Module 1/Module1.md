# Metacrafters Etherium Intro Course

### ****Create Entire Cities and New Forms of Work****

Our companies and organizations are limited by trust. If we don’t have a contract or trust the people we want to work with, little gets done. DAOs solves this for decentralized work.

Individuals can come together to solve big problems and trust one another thanks to a smart contract, often built on Ethereum.

This smart contract is the backbone of a DAO. It defines the rules of the organization and holds the group's treasury. Once the contract is live on Ethereum, no one can change the rules except by a vote.

This is a huge opportunity because now people can come and contribute one idea or work full-time on a project and still get compensated and have a voice based on their contribution.

### **Inspire Customer Loyalty***

Companies like Starbucks use the Ethereum blockchain to store a customer’s loyalty information. This enables customers to own these perks and even trade them with other coffee drinkers.

### ****Guarantee Privacy and Ownership of Identity****

Ethereum enables us to own our own identity and use a decentralized identifier. Our key details are stored in our wallets, and specific information can be shared when needed without revealing other parts of our identity.

Imagine not having to call the registrar for your diploma, logging into a website without giving your email, or proving you are old enough for a beer without giving your address and personal details. This is all possible with decentralized identity build on Ethereum.

### **Own Digital Assets with NFTs**

NFTs represent ownership of any digital asset. While art is a popular use case, NFTs can be used for anything from home ownership to fractional ownership of a lyric or hook in a song.

The vast majority of NFTs are built on Ethereum.

## ****From Web1 to Web3****

As **[MetaMask](https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/what-is-web3)** describes it: "Web3 is an umbrella term for the vision of a better internet; an internet with an added identity, money, and social layer. An internet built upon open protocols that value transparency and innovation. An internet that siphons power away from big corporations, and instead places you at the helm of your data."

**The Web3 Era** You can think of the Web3 era as the next stage of creation on the Internet.

This era is built on the ability to trust over the internet - often called "trustless coordination." The ability to work with others, without knowing them and without a trusted intermediary, is unlocking a new era of creation and collaboration.

### **The Three C's of Web3**

The web3 era is typified by three guiding principles:

- Control
- Composability
- de(centralization)

### **Control**

Control - or ownership - is a key concept in web3. As MetaMask notes: "In Web2 (mainstream internet today), if you want to move to a new platform, you can’t bring your history with you in a way that retains its legitimacy.

You have to start all over since the platform owns your data and profits from it. Whereas with Web3, you can choose to take your data and money to another platform whenever you want as you aren’t anchored down. The database and platform become the equivalent of a global utility, accessible and open to anyone for any purpose."

This clip from Naval Ravikant explains the thinking of control in web3:

### **Composability**

Composability is the ability to take something that others have built and reuse, update, remix, and create. Much like open-source content, the hope of web3 is to enable collaboration to build faster and better.

### **deCentralization**

Web3 aims to decentralize data. As opposed to a central identity controlling information - such as a bank or a social media platform - web3 enables individuals to collaborate and trust each other directly.

## ****What is Trust?****

### **Vires in numeris**

This saying is another early Bitcoin maxim that means "Truth in numbers."

As Kernel notes, the implicit shift towards trusting those we're actually transacting with is enabled due to a fundamental change in the language by which value is defined. Instead of regulatory fiat, enforced by legal prose and human courts backed by the threat of violence; web3 currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum enables a network of peers to create the conditions required for a functional currency through mathematics alone, enforced by deterministic computation.

# ****Understanding the Blockchain****

At the heart of web3, is the **blockchain**. As you learned in the last lesson, this is like a huge spreadsheet shared by everyone. The fancy name for this is **distributed ledger technology**.

# ****Coordinating Across the Blockchain****

The old one, called Proof of Work (PoW), is like a competitive puzzle-solving contest where miners race to solve complex mathematical problems to earn rewards. The catch is that the puzzles are designed to be increasingly difficult, and the more people mining, the harder they get. This means that miners need expensive equipment and lots of electricity, creating an inefficient and environmentally-unfriendly system.

The new mechanism, Proof of Stake (PoS), is like a team sport where validators are incentivized to work together to keep the network secure. Instead of racing to solve puzzles, validators stake their own cryptocurrency and are rewarded for following the rules and penalized for misbehavior. This creates a more sustainable and cost-effective system, with fewer barriers to entry.

Switching from PoW to PoS was a big move for Ethereum, but it shows the platform's commitment to innovation and sustainability. By using consensus mechanisms like PoS, Ethereum is creating a system where everyone can play nicely together, creating a more collaborative and efficient future for blockchain technology.
